# My_First_Website
Created my first ever website by using only pure HTML elements.  

Main Highlights are :  
--> A very basic website created by me during my hands-on while learning HTML.   
--> It doesn't even consist a single element from CSS or any other language except pure HTML.  
--> Can be modified later on stage to make it more professional(Optional).  

Codebase contains only two basic files :  
1. Index.html : contains all the codebase of the created website.
2. favicon.ico : contains the small favicon of a dog since the website is themed upon cute dogs.
