# Cute_Dogs_Website 
Webiste Link :  https://nilesh-c-01.github.io/Cute_Dogs_Website/  
Created my first ever website by using only pure HTML elements.  

Main Highlights are :  
--> A very basic website created by me during my hands-on while learning HTML.   
--> It doesn't even consist a single element from CSS or any other language except pure HTML.  
--> Can be modified later on stage to make it more professional(Optional).  

Codebase contains only four basic files :  
1. Index.html : contains all the codebase of the created website.
2. Favicon.ico : contains the small favicon of a dog since the website is themed upon cute dogs.
3. Readme.md : readme file for a brief about the website and the work.
4. License : automatically generated by GitHub for the desired license.
